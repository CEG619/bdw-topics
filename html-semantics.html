  						Semantics can be summed up as the implied meaning of a subject. When it comes to HTML, it is how both us humans, and machines can speak and understand the same language. My favorite quote from this article was &lsquo;A computer doesn&rsquo;t care if you had pizza for dinner. It likely just wants to know what on earth it should do with that information&rsquo;  A computer doesn&rsquo;t care why we are putting in this content, it just wants to know how and where to display the information.  That being said, we as pattern seeking life forms have to make some sense of how we distinguish, categorize, and present, this data through our machine brothers and sisters.  This seems to be a never-ending back and forth debate on how many elements there should be and how many newly suggested elements can be categorized under an element that already exists. From what I've seem to pick up through this article, once you look past the actual names of the elements and focus on their actual meaning, it becomes much easier to write your markup.  As with most stuff, if you K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Stupid) you&rsquo;ll do a lot better. Plus, you can always go back and change it &mdash; code is written on a screen, not in stone.

					This was a pretty broad article about all things HTML, but I found great definitions for the new semantic elements in HTML5. The new semantics help make existing markup shorter and help define content in new ways.  The section element represents a generic document or application section. It is often a thematic grouping of content with a heading. This can be used for tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or a websites home page could be divided into sections like the about us page, contact information, or product information. The nav element of a page links to other pages or to parts within the page. Only sections that mark major navigation blocks should use the nav element.  The article element represents a component of a page that consists of a self-contained composition that is intended to be independently reusable. Things like a newspaper article, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget, or a forum post.  The aside element consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element and could be separate from that content. Often used for sidebars, advertising, and/or groups of nav elements.  Hggroup element represents the heading of a section and is used when the heading has multiple levels like subheadings, alternative titles, or taglines. The header element represents a group of introductory or navigation aids. It can often contain an hggroup element.  The footer element represents a footer for its closest sectioning content or sectioning root element. It usually helps define information like who wrote it, links to contact, license agreements, and other page information. The time element usually represents a time on a 24 hour clock or a precise date. The mark element represents an area of text in a marked or highlighted document for referral purposes.  A lot of info right there, but this definitely helped point me in the right direction when knowing which element to use.
