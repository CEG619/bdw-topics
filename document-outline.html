  						This article reviewed the basics of the document outlining algorithm and some ideal things to keep an eye out for. The Document Outlining Algorithm is essentially the bone structure or the table of contents of the webpage.  Two things affect the hierarchy of that structure: Heading content ("implicit sectioning" using heading tags like h1 through h6) and sectioning content ("explicit sectioning" like section, article, aside, and nav).  It gave examples of varied combinations of these two types of sectioning and how they should be used together.  The theme I got from using the sectioning types together was: &lsquo;Respect those that have come before you.&rsquo; Label your heading content appropriately within the newly added (to HTML5) sectioning content tags.  There are multiple ways to go about marking up the hierarchy within your coding, but for purposes like: optimal search engine results, assistive technology readers, older operating systems/browsers, and keeping simple and understandable order of your code writing, you should use elements of the appropriate rank for the section's nesting level. (h1, then h2, then h3 etc.)  The article went on to call attention to some of the common mistakes and situations to look out for when drafting your document outline.  Then, like any good worker bee, with your own eyes and the many tools, specifically the <a href="http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/">gsnedders  HTML5 design outliner</a>, check your work!

					This article was similar to the article above in the sense of giving a good overall background to the HTML5 and the importance of having a solid Document Outline.  Reading this second article helped shed light on some of the things I wasn't fully wrapping my head around with the first article. It detailed the sectioning elements and sectioning roots in a little better way and went further into explaining hggroups.  This article also drives home the importance of sectioning heading elements correctly and pointing out that HTML5 is still relatively new and the user agent must code respectively for search engine optimization and screen readers.
